### Dynamic Networks: Analysis and Modeling 

Our research focuses on machine Learning on graphs with emphasize in explainability, chemoinformatics, and bioinformatics, and social networks.


**Graph Machine Learning and Explainability**

We develop novel methods for analyzing graph representations and their relationship to the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) generating them and to the downstream tasks. Our interests include manifold analysis for quantifying the similarity between two representation spaces and robust means for comparing and aligning representations. 

**AI for Science**

Our work integrates machine learning with multiscale modeling to enhance scientific insights and discoveries. By combining physics-based knowledge with data-driven approaches, we aim to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics, analyze sensitivities, and quantify uncertainty across various scientific domains. 

**Brain Imaging and Bioinformatics**

In the realm of neuroscience, we are developing deep learning, statistical, and optimization frameworks to aid in the interpretability of the brain and cognition. Our methods focus on discovering the relationship between input images and brain responses, as well as understanding how functional and structural networks interrelate.
